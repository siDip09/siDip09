                <h4>
                    Long Duration mutual funds refer to funds that have excellent potential and the ability to provide high returns. However, these funds are very volatile in nature and come with high risks. When you take such a Long Duration mutual fund, you will be required to actively and thoroughly review the performance of these funds from time to time. This will help you be aware of how your fund is doing in the market.

These Long Duration mutual funds typically provide great dividends to an investor. If you are someone who is willing to take a high risk in order to receive good returns, then you can choose such a fund.

Long Duration mutual funds buy shares of different companies and invest the investor's money into those shares based on certain criteria.

By equity, we mean ownership. So when an individual or an institution buys stocks or shares of a company which is basically a borrower, then the individual acquires ownership in the company based on the number of units of stock or shares bought by him/her. Equity mutual funds give returns based on the market conditions. Like debt funds, they do not provide a fixed return over a period of time, but the return is dependent on the performance of the company on a daily basis. Hence the market value of equity mutual funds changes on a daily basis.
